VaultX is a Lattice-based Post Quantum Cryptography Password Manager. It was designed by Soham Roy, Naithick Accha, Karthikeya Devaraj and Binit Balak Sen at the 2025 GCSRM OSS 2.0 Hackathon.
A detailed overview of Lattice-based PQC is available in Presentation 9.pdf. 
bruteforce.py contains an animation of the process.
liboqs-python.zip includes the backend code, and a GUI application to execute it. (NOTE: As of now, we are unable to input Dilithium decryption)
We also want to implement this system into a website for public use. CompleteWebsite.zip contains a prototype, with biometric face scanning system. To change reference face, replace Reference.jpeg with your own image.
